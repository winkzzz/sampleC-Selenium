Shakeout notes
- this is using a framework named MAQs
- there were 2 persons who worked on this one, I'm one of them
- this is from my previous client and this is deprecated already
- this was created few years ago

SeleniumTest.cs notes
- this was created few days ago
- used to asses my coding skill given a small amount of time (30mins)
- within the 30mins, in includes the setup of selenium on my machine
- this can be run right away given that selenium is set already on your machine
- this is written without framework, plain C# selenium only and still can be improved
